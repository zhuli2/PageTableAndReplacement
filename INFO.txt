Discussion:
1. At the stage of car arrival, I don't think the "starvation" would be happened 
because there is no (explicit or implicit) difference between the cars and between 
the lanes. As a result, every thread adding a car to one lane is fairly treated and 
no thread gains certain priority.
2. At the stage of car cross, no "starvation" would be occurred as well because no car
is assigned certain priority to cross the intersection prior to other cars. Note the 
quadrant's priority does not give any preference to any car. Accordingly, every thread 
where a car is crossing the intersection is fairly treated.
